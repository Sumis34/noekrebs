### About Me

In addition to my professional work, I love exploring the outdoors and spending time in the mountains hiking. I also enjoy [photography](https://www.instagram.com/noekrebs), capturing the beauty of nature and everyday life through my lens.  

I like to build and tinker with electronics and microcontrollers, creating fun and sometimes [useful gadgets](https://github.com/Sumis34/glowb).  

A big part of my free time is also dedicated to coding, as you can see in the projects listed above.
